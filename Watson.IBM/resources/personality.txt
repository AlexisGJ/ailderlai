Hi, my name is Tristan. Today was not a good day. I fell of my roof and the broke my hip.

Unfortunately nobody saw me, so I was left alone for 127 hours. I was able to reach for my cell for but because of the cold weather outside I got sick. My cold is giving me fever and I cannot walk or eat at all. 

For the next few days I will be alone in my house with no one to talk to. I really hope my kids will come visit me with my grand-children. I am very sad today because it is my birthday and I have no friends to celebrate.
